# Responesive calculated

**Description:**
The Responsive Calculator project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, thanks to its responsive design.

**Key Features:**

1. **Responsive Design:** The calculator adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The calculator features a clean and intuitive user interface with large, easy-to-press buttons for numbers and operators.

3. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease. The calculator displays both the input and the result, making it clear and straightforward.

4. **Clear and All-Clear (C/AC) Buttons:** Users can clear the current input with the "C" button and clear the entire calculation with the "AC" button.

5. **Decimal Point:** The calculator supports decimal numbers, allowing for precise calculations.

**Technologies Used:**

- **HTML:** The structure of the calculator's user interface is created using HTML, including buttons for numbers and operators.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style and format the calculator, making it visually appealing and responsive.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is responsible for the calculator's functionality, including handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.

**Project Structure:**

- `index.html`: The HTML file that defines the calculator's structure and layout, including buttons and display area.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file that applies styles to the calculator, ensuring a visually pleasing and responsive design.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for capturing user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.

**How to Use:**

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. Use the calculator by clicking the number buttons, decimal point, and operator buttons.
3. To clear the current input, press the "C" button.
4. To clear the entire calculation, press the "AC" button.
5. The result of the calculation will be displayed in the calculator's output area.

**Why This Project:**
The Responsive Calculator project is a great way to practice front-end development skills and create a useful tool that can be accessed on various devices. It's a practical exercise for building responsive web applications and applying basic JavaScript logic for mathematical operations. Additionally, it can serve as a starting point for more complex calculator projects with advanced features.
